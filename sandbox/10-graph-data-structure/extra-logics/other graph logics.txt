1. Graph Libraries:
There are also JavaScript libraries that provide more advanced graph structures and algorithms. One popular library is NetworkX, which is often used in combination with visualization libraries like D3.js for graph visualization.

2. Graph Algorithms:
JavaScript can also be used to implement various graph algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and more. These algorithms can be implemented using the graph representations mentioned above.

3. Visualization:
For visualizing graphs, you can use libraries like D3.js, which provides powerful tools for creating interactive and visually appealing graph visualizations in web applications.

Remember that graph algorithms can become quite complex, and the choice of representation and algorithm depends on the specific problem you're trying to solve. If you have a specific question or problem related to working with graphs in JavaScript, feel free to ask for more detailed information!
