/**In JavaScript, a tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a value and can have zero or more child nodes. The topmost node of a tree is called the "root," and nodes with no children are referred to as "leaves."

There are various types of trees, such as binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more. Here, I'll provide a general overview of how to implement a basic tree data structure in JavaScript. */

class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(node) {
    if (node instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(node);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Can only add instances of TreeNode as children.");
    }
  }
}

class Tree {
  constructor(rootValue) {
    this.root = new TreeNode(rootValue);
  }
}

/**In this example, we have two classes: TreeNode and Tree. The TreeNode class represents a single node in the tree. It has a value property to store the node's value and a children array to store references to its child nodes. The addChild method allows you to add child nodes to a given parent node.

The Tree class represents the entire tree structure. It has a root property that holds the root node of the tree.

Here's how you could create a simple tree using these classes: */

const tree = new Tree("A");

const rootNode = tree.root;
const nodeB = new TreeNode("B");
const nodeC = new TreeNode("C");

rootNode.addChild(nodeB);
rootNode.addChild(nodeC);

const nodeD = new TreeNode("D");
nodeB.addChild(nodeD);

console.log(tree);

/**This creates a tree with the following structure: 
 * 
 * 
      A
     / \
    B   C
    |
    D

*/

/**Please note that this is a very basic example. Depending on your use case, you might need to implement more complex features such as traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order), searching, deleting nodes, and balancing (for certain types of trees). There are also libraries available, such as the D3.js library, that provide more advanced tree visualization capabilities. */
