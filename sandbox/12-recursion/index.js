/**Recursion in JavaScript refers to the practice of a function calling itself as part of its own execution. 
 Recursive functions are used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. 
 When implementing recursive functions, it's important to have a base case that defines when the recursion 
 should stop, preventing infinite loops.

Here's a simple example of a recursive function in JavaScript: */

function countdown(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    console.log("Blastoff!");
  } else {
    console.log(n);
    countdown(n - 1); // Recursive call
  }
}

countdown(5);

/**In this example, the countdown function prints numbers from n down to 1, and then prints "Blastoff!" when n reaches 0. 
 * The base case is when n is less than or equal to 0, which stops the recursion.

Here are a few key points to consider when working with recursive functions:

1. Base Case: Ensure that your recursive function has a base case that specifies when the recursion should stop. 
Without a base case, the function could keep calling itself indefinitely.

2. Recursive Case: In the recursive part of the function, break down the problem into smaller subproblems that 
are similar in nature to the original problem.

3. Progress Toward Base Case: In each recursive call, make sure the parameters or inputs are moving closer to 
the base case. This ensures that the recursion eventually reaches the base case.

4. Stack Limit: JavaScript (and most programming languages) have a limit on the number of function calls that 
can be nested due to memory constraints. This is known as the "call stack." Recursion can lead to a "stack overflow" 
error if the recursion depth becomes too deep.

5. Performance: Recursive functions can be elegant, but they might not always be the most efficient solution. 
In some cases, using iteration or other approaches might be more efficient.

6. Tail Recursion: Tail recursion is a special type of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation 
performed in the function. Some programming languages optimize tail-recursive calls to be more memory-efficient, 
but JavaScript doesn't provide automatic optimization for tail recursion.

Recursion is a powerful concept, but it's important to use it judiciously and make sure your functions have proper 
base cases and termination conditions to avoid infinite loops or excessive memory usage. */
